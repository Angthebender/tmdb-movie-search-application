# tmdb-movie-search-application
This project is a React-based movie browsing app that connects to The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie data. Users can view popular movies, search for specific titles, and paginate through the results â€” all in a sleek, responsive UI using Bootstrap.
